# OpenVPS

*OpenVPS* is a global-scale federated and widely-distributed mapping and localization service. Here, we provide the documentation and links to some tools built for *OpenVPS*.

## Geo-domain Explorer

<a href="https://openvps.github.io/geo-domain-explorer/" target="_blank">Geo-domain Explorer tool</a> visualizes the geo-domains that are queried by an OpenVPS device for a given location and confidence radius. It also automates the creation of DNS records needed to register a map server to make it discoverable by OpenVPS. See [Geo-domain explorer]({% link pages/tools/geodomain-explorer.md %}) section for documentation.

## Waypoint Tagger 

<a href="https://openvps.github.io/waypoint-tagger/" target="_blank">Waypoint Tagger tool</a> helps map creators visualize their 3D map and tag waypoints on it. The creators can also export their waypoints to be used with the map server. See [Waypoint Tagger]({% link pages/tools/waypoint-tagger.md %}) section for documentation.
